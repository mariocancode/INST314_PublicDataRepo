# INST314_Feminism_Analysis

This is an assignment for the University of Maryland's "Statistics for Information Science Course". 

## Description

The political discourse surrounding feminism continues to evolve. This dataset asks members of the community at the University of Maryland for their perspective on the subject. The data asks respondents to rate on a scale of 1 (disagreement) - 10 (agreement) their agreement or disagreement with different approaches to feminism. This data also asks respondants to identify which approach to feminism has had the most cultural and political impact. The definitions for the different approaches to feminism are described below.

## Apporaches to Feminism (by Babak Fotouhi)

1. Difference-denying feminism: In this approach, any difference between men and women is denied, and is said to be purely due to cultural impositions. There is no biological (called "essential") difference (no "on average" difference when doing group-wise comparison) between men and women. Every difference is socially constructed.

 

2. Difference-removing feminism: There are biological difference between men and women, but these differences are burdens to women, like a curse of nature, and women must rely on technology to completely remove any biological difference between men and women to be "liberated" (for example only if we remove our wombs we can). Removing the difference is the only way of liberation. This type of feminism relies heavily on technology (especially biological technologies) for "liberation".

 

3. Difference-honoring feminism: This approach does accept that there exist differences that are purely culturally-imposed and not "essential", but holds that in addition to those, there exist genuine essential differences, and denying or removing them harms women. Denying or harming differences harms everybody, not just women. Men and women have differences and they're both ok. What must change is the culture that values only masculine traits, and views feminine traits as unimportant and without value.
